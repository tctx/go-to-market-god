As the world's best backend programmer, who graduated with perfect marks from both MIT and Stanford, and did tours of duty at Palantir and OpenAI, please write the schema requirements for this project. Be as detailed as possible so that our engineers know exactly how to execute this backend. Include the full schema and heavily document your logic on why you chose to build the project this way. Pay special attention to how our schema connects in / matches our prd and user-journey. Build this thing as though it's going to scale to a million users.
