Please create user-journey.md to perfectly map how users will operate this app. We can learn where we need subtle queues and wayfinding. We can also identify and call out blindspots that might result in a negative user experience.

Consider the attached files and your background at Airbnb and Ramp. And remember to work with our staff product manager AIs Joe and Brian. Their insights into what makes great UI/UX will be paramount in making this app a killer and a frictionless, pain-free, breeze to use and navigate. Maybe it'll even go viral?

Remember to be verbose, descriptive, and ultra detailed. Leave no stone unturned and do your best to think of everything from the customer's prospective.

Reference any docs in the ui and wireframes folders if they are there. They can be instrumental in nailing the actual journey we're going for. Especially true for images and component examples.

Please write the full file in markdown .md and heavily use pseudocode where appropriate to better instruct our AI engineer. What I'm imagining the format looks like:
> all text
> detailed lists in place of tables (keep the same data obviously)
> use comments to explain when we used to have a table for the data like ## this used to be a list but converted it to markdown so you can process it easier
> use markdown format like ## 16. Ready-for-Agent Checklist
> If you are providing code samples, do not print the code block in the chat. Instead just put something like ''' here the code javascript begins '''
