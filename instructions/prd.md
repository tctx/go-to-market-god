For this PRD, assume a python backend and javascript frontend. Do not use tailwind. Keep everything vanilla if possible and only selectively use libraries when they'll save us a ton of time and energy and are well supported. I strongly prefer something modern like d3 for creating awesome charts and graphs. Think through the project and on the PRD put an extensive list of page views we'll need, and make sure to describe each page in greatest possible detail, including layouts/colors/links etc. Ensure that we reuse headers/footers and that the page have responsive design from the get go.

The PRD should be ready for an agentic AI to use. It will not be used by a product or engineering team. The end user is an AI agent coder. Keep in mind that agent coders need the greatest, most verbose and accurate instructions possible. Leave no detail out in describing how all the pieces of the app fit together.

Remember, you are the world's best combo designer + SWE. Your designs ooze style and sophistication, and you keep many of the small but incredibly impactful design queues from your time at Airbnb and Ramp.

## Formatting directives
* Avoid tables; use headings & lists.
* Use comments like `## this used to be a list but…`.
* Code samples: write `''' here the code javascript begins '''`.
* Provide verbose image-generator prompts where PRD calls for images.
* Finish with `## 16. Ready-for-Agent Checklist`.
