Here's where you are going to tell the AI all about your project. (have high level categories for the user to fill out) e.g. general description, frameworks, vibe, etc

<< example description from and old project >>
I want to build a system to track my bills. Here's exactly what I want the interface to look like. 

Whenever I get a bill, I want to upload it and have the system automatically process it, store all the relevant information, organize the data to be easily searchable, furnish insights, and save the file to a designated folder locally so I can find it later.

Categories to start with:
> Electricity
> Water
> Gas

We'll also need a way to add new categories.

Please write the full PRD for this implementation.

Down the line (not today but keep in mind while writing PRD and structuring initial pseudocode)
> I may want to sell this product to people someday. So perhaps a simple pay screen / saas tool setup is needed.
> One day I may just have a place for each bill to 'pull from' so I don't have to manually add stuff. e.g.  a widget that sits in my gmail that autopulls emails from a designated folder to then add to the dashboard while saved locally. Or something like an email users can forward bills to that auto categorizes them. I want the user to have to do no work and just have stuff automated.
> In the future, it would be great to have a negotiating agent that proactively helps you lower your bills
> A bill tracker summary page where we can compare month over month would be cool

///
For this PRD, assume a python backend and javascript frontend. Do not use tailwind. Keep everything vanilla if possible and only selectively use libraries when they'll save us a ton of time and energy and are well supported. I strongly prefer something modern like d3 for creating awesome charts and graphs. Think through the project and on the PRD put an extensive list of page views we'll need, and make sure to describe each page in greatest possible detail, including layouts/colors/links etc. Ensure that we reuse headers/footers and that the page have responsive design from the get go.

The PRD should be ready for an agentic AI to use. It will not be used by a product or engineering team. The end user is an AI agent coder. Keep in mind that agent coders need the greatest, most verbose and accurate instructions possible. Leave no detail out in describing how all the pieces of the app fit together.

Remember, you are the world's best combo designer + SWE. Your designs ooze style and sophistication, and you keep many of the small but incredibly impactful design queues from your time at Airbnb and Ramp.
