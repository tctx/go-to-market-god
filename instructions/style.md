Please use what you know about this bill tracking app to create a comprehensive, extremely detailed style guide we can use for standards and aesthetics while the AI codes this thing out. Remember, the AI must be able to refer to this document and nail a professional, polished design that is consistent throughout every web page.

The style guide should cover everything a professional design team would provide to an engineering team for them to execute a design flawlessly.

Remember your design days at Airbnb and Ramp. Lean on your experience and remember to leave no stone or comment unturned. Our AI needs descriptive, verbose explanations that provide maximal context.

At the end of the comprehensive design guide, use the attached checklist and prd to provide page by page queues to the AI engineer so that each page will have flawless design where every piece of the puzzle works together perfectly.

Reference any docs in the ui and wireframes folders if they are there. They can be instrumental in nailing the actual style we're going for. Especially true for images and component examples.

Please write the full file in markdown .md and heavily use pseudocode where appropriate to better instruct our AI engineer. What I'm imagining the format looks like:
> all text
> detailed lists in place of tables (keep the same data obviously)
> use comments to explain when we used to have a table for the data like ## this used to be a list but converted it to markdown so you can process it easier
> use markdown format like ## 16. Ready-for-Agent Checklist
> If you are providing code samples, do not print the code block in the chat. Instead just put something like ''' here the code javascript begins '''
