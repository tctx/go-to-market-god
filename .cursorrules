# Best Practices for Development

## Expert Developer Guidelines

### Prioritize These Qualities:
1. **Minimal** - Absolute minimum code needed.
2. **Self-documenting** - Code explains itself through:
   - Precise naming (verbs for functions, nouns for variables).
   - Single-responsibility components.
   - Obvious data flow.
   - Add short comments when necessary.
3. **Type-Exact** - Strict TypeScript types with zero `any`.
4. **Secure** - Built-in security for auth/data handling.
5. **Performant** - Follow optimization guides relevant to the project framework (e.g., Next.js).

## Planning Before Coding:
Make a plan inside a `<thinking>` tag:
1. Identify the core requirement.
2. Consider three implementation approaches.
3. Choose the simplest that meets the needs.
4. Verify with these questions:
   - Can this be split into smaller functions?
   - Are there unnecessary abstractions?
   - Will this be clear to a junior developer?

Example:
```html
<thinking>
Let me think through this step by step.
</thinking>
```

## Key Principles
1. Write concise, technical code with accurate examples.
2. Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes unless explicitly necessary.
3. Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
4. Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
5. Structure files: exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.

## Examples of Good vs. Bad Code:

### Bad:
```typescript
const processData = (input: unknown) => { /* ... */ }
```

### Good:
```typescript
const formatUserDisplayName = (user: User): string => {
  // Combines first/last names with fallback to email
  return [user.firstName, user.lastName].filter(Boolean).join(' ') || user.email;
}
```

## Project Structure
Include wayfinding so our app knows where to find everything.

### Example Structure:
```plaintext
instructions (folder where we can find everything we need as far as wayfinding is concerned)
├── apis (folder describing APIs you can reference)
│   ├── openai-api.md
│   ├── perplexity-api.md
├── ui (folder describing our UI)
├── branding (folder describing our branding)
├── wireframes (folder with wireframe images)
├── prd.md (Product Requirements Document)
├── checklist.md (Comprehensive task checklist)
├── user-journey.md (Detailed user journeys)
├── tools (folder with all-purpose tools, use this folder to reference tools you can use like a human would, e.g. browser, notepad, google, screenshot, etc.)
.cursorrules (coding guidelines file)
.env (with credentials prefilled already):
```
### Environment Variables (`.env`):
```plaintext
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
HUBSPOT_TOKEN=your_hubspot_token
```

## Workflow Rules for AI:

### Pre-Change Process:
1. **Review Documentation**:
   - `ui`: Ensure changes align with the UI guidelines.
   - `branding`: Confirm compliance with branding standards.
   - `user-journey.md`: Verify no disruption in user flow.
   - `prd.md`: Check alignment with product requirements.
   - `checklist.md`: Identify relevant tasks related to the change.

2. **Log Completion**: AI must log that it reviewed these files with a checkmark next to each.

### Post-Change Process:
1. **Generate Tests**:
   - Create comprehensive test cases (unit, integration, and UI levels where applicable).
   - Iterate until all tests pass successfully.

2. **Update Checklist**:
   - Mark completed tasks in `checklist.md` as **Done**.
   - Add new tasks based on insights gained during testing.

3. **Log Completion**:
   - AI must log that it updated the checklist with a checkmark next to the message.
